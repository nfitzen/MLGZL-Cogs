# MLG Zilean's Install Lots of Cogs

Cogs intended for the MLG Zilean's Discord server (which is private),
for use with that server's [Red-DiscordBot] instance.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. When submitting a PR, make sure to read
the [license rules](license_rules.md). Something might not be listed there,
though, so just follow common sense if that document doesn't cover enough.
Expect for me to be pedantic about licensing.

## Copyright

Copyright (C) 2021 [nfitzen](https://github.com/nfitzen)

Most code within this repository is licensed under [`AGPL-3.0-or-later`].
That is, the GNU Affero General Public License, either version 3,
or (at your option) any later version.

Some (or all) modules in this repository might have an additional
exception that you can find
at [`LicenseRef-ModuleException`](LICENSES/LicenseRef-ModuleException.txt).

This project is [REUSE-compliant](https://reuse.software/):
see [`LICENSES`](LICENSES/) for a list of licenses,
and see individual files for their [`SPDX-License-Identifier` tags][1]
and individual copyright notices.

Note that some files may have different copyright notices or licenses,
such as [`.gitignore`](.gitignore).

### Module Exception

I made a custom AGPL module exception for code in this repo, as stated above.
Such a module exception is marked with [CC0 1.0], so feel free to use it
however you like.

### Other Projects

The following are license indications from other projects with which this
project is intended to be linked or combined.

#### [Red-DiscordBot]

Red is licensed under what appears to be [`GPL-3.0-only`],
but God only knows because they are ridiculously unclear about licensing.
They apparently try to use the GPL's header instructions as a license
statement, as if that's obvious at all (and can't only be interpreted by highly
experienced lawyers).

So it's either [`GPL-3.0-only`] or [`GPL-3.0-or-later`]. Regardless, it's
some form of GPLv3, which means this repo license is compatible.

(It's really annoying. I encourage the project to explicitly move to
[`GPL-3.0-or-later`] by contacting all significant contributors.)

See the project for more information.
